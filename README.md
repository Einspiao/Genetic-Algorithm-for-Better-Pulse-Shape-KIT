Genetic Algorithm Searching for Better Pulse Shape

The Python notebook contains the code I used in KIT searching for optimum readout pulse shape. It relies on Qclient, a hardware control package.

The "Thesis Draft" is a summary of this experiment. All details about the Genetic Algorithm used here can be found in it.
